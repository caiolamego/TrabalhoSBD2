CL_FREQ: This code list provides a set of values indicating the "frequency" of the data (e.g. weekly, monthly, quarterly). The concept “frequency” may refer to various stages in the production process, e.g. data collection or data dissemination. For example, a time series could be disseminated at annual frequency but the underlying data are compiled monthly. The code list is applicable for all different uses of "frequency". This code list was formally adopted on 4 December 2013.
